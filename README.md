# Contact Search Application

A frontend implementation of a contact search interface originally designed for Salesforce OmniStudio. This project was developed as a vanilla JavaScript solution due to limited access to the OmniStudio platform.

## Original Assignment Context

The original assignment required implementing a contact search interface in Salesforce OmniStudio. However, due to access limitations to the Salesforce platform, this implementation was created using standard web technologies to demonstrate the required frontend development skills.

### Assignment Requirements

1. **Search Interface**

   - Create a responsive contact search form
   - Implement multiple search filters
   - Display search results in a tabular format

2. **Required Search Fields**

   - First Name
   - Last Name (marked as required)
   - Date of Birth
   - Email Address
   - Phone Number
   - Address Information (Street, City, State, Zip)

3. **Results Display Requirements**

   - Show results in a paginated table
   - Include checkbox/radio selection
   - Display all contact information in columns
   - Implement single contact selection

4. **Contact Selection Feature**
   - Allow selection of a single contact
   - Display selected contact details
   - Show complete address information

## Implementation Approach

Without access to OmniStudio, the solution was built using:

### Frontend Technologies
